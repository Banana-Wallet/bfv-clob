# Private CLOB

Implementation of simple matching algorithm which can find match for encrypted orders proposed in this [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/923.pdf). This matching algorithms is implemented with bfv fully homomorphic encryption algorithm to facilitate order matching
for encrypted orders. We used [bfv](https://github.com/Janmajayamall/bfv) and [operator](https://github.com/Janmajayamall/caird/tree/main/operators) library by [Janmajayamall](https://github.com/Janmajayamall)
